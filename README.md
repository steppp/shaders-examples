# Shaders examples

## About

This repo contains some example shaders built as exercise. It uses [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) to serve files and run the node server.

You can find them under `src/shaders/test/fragment.glsl`. Activate one or another by calling the respective function in the `main` method.

## Demo

- Clone the repository
- Run `npm install`
- After all packages have been installed, run `npm run dev`
- Go to `localhost:8000` and see the magic happen!
